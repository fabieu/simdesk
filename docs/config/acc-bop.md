## Description

The `acc-bop` feature enables the Balance of Performance (BoP) Management features as well as the BoP Editor.

The BoP Management feature provides a way to save and publish BoP definitions for all available tracks and cars in
Assetto
Corsa Competizione. You can also download and share the corresponding definitions.

The standalone BoP Editor is used to create and manipulate Assetto Corsa Competizione `bop.json` files.

Enable the Balance of Performance features by adding `acc-bop` to `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`.

## Management Feature

The BoP definitions are publicly visible to all users. The management interface, which enables the creation and
editing of BoP definitions, is currently only accessible to the admin user. A finer-grained access control is planned
for the future.
